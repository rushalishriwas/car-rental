Creating a car rental system project in Python is a great way to practice your programming skills and work with object-oriented design, file handling, and possibly databases. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of how you can structure such a project, followed by a basic implementation.
High-Level Overview
Requirements
Manage a list of cars with attributes like make, model, and availability.
Allow users to view available cars, book a car, and return a car.
Track rental history.
Handle basic user input and provide feedback.
Components
Car Class: Represents individual cars.
RentalSystem Class: Manages the list of cars and handles booking/returning.
User Interface: Provides methods for interacting with the system (console-based for simplicity).
Enhancements
Persistence: Save and load car data from a file or database.
User Accounts: Add functionality for multiple users, reservations, etc.
Graphical User Interface: Use a library like Tkinter for a GUI.
This basic implementation will help you understand the core concepts of a car rental system. As you progress, you can add more features and improve the system based on your requirements.
